## Visual AI Agent Skeleton with Daydreams and O[mniParser

# Overview
This project provides a skeleton base for integrating Daydreams with OmniParser to create an AI agent capable of understanding and interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It's designed as a starting point for developers to customize, extend, and adapt to specific use cases involving visual parsing and AI-driven decision-making. 

# Features
Screen Parsing: Utilizes a skeleton of OmniParser functionality to analyze screenshots for UI elements.
AI Decision Making: Leverages the Daydreams framework to make context-aware decisions based on parsed visual data.
Groq Integration: Includes a placeholder for Groq's language model to analyze visual inputs or plan actions.
Real-time Interaction: Simulates capturing, parsing, and acting on screens in real-time.

# Requirements
Python: Version 3.8 or higher.
Dependencies:
fastapi
pydantic
groq
torch
requests

Install dependencies with:
bash
pip install fastapi pydantic groq torch requests

# Setup
Environment Variables
GROQ_API_KEY: Set this in your environment before running the script:
bash
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# File Structure
This skeleton project includes:

src/visual_ai_agent.py - Main script for setting up the server and agent.
util/omniparser.py - A skeleton OmniParser implementation.
tools/screen_capture.py - Basic screen capture utility.
weights/ - Contains dummy model files for:
icon_detect/model.pt
icon_caption_florence/model.safetensors

# Configuration
OmniParser Weights: The weights provided are dummy files for demonstration. Replace these with actual trained models for real use.
Module Imports: Adjust import statements if util.omniparser or tools.screen_capture paths differ from the skeleton setup.

# Usage
To run the skeleton system:

bash
python src/visual_ai_agent.py

This will:
Start a simulated OmniParser server on localhost:8000.
Initialize a Daydreams agent with placeholder functionalities.

# How It Works
This skeleton:
Screen Capture: Uses a basic screenshot capture function.
Image Parsing: Simulates parsing with dummy data; actual parsing would require implementing real model logic.
Data Storage: Stores dummy parsed data in the agent's memory context.
Analysis: Placeholder for Groq analysis; customize with actual API calls or model interactions.
Action: Executes mock actions based on the simulated analysis.

# Customization
Models: Replace dummy model files with your trained models.
Server URL: Modify if not using localhost:8000.
Agent Actions: Extend or modify actions in the Daydreams agent for your specific needs.

# Development
Error Handling: Implement proper error catching and logging.
Logging: Add detailed logging for debugging and monitoring.
Security: Secure API key handling and consider server authentication.

# Testing
Unit Tests: Write tests for each module to ensure they work as intended.
Integration Tests: Test the interaction between components.
