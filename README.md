Visual AI Agent Skeleton
An integration framework combining Daydreams and OmniParser for GUI-aware AI agents.
Overview
This project provides a foundation for building AI agents that can understand and interact with graphical user interfaces. By combining Daydreams for decision-making with OmniParser for visual understanding, developers can create custom solutions for visual parsing and AI-driven automation.
Key Features

Visual Understanding: Screen parsing and UI element detection using OmniParser
Intelligent Decision Making: Context-aware processing through the Daydreams framework
Groq Integration: Language model integration for visual analysis and action planning
Real-time Processing: Live capture and analysis of screen content

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Required packages:
bashCopypip install fastapi pydantic groq torch requests


Environment Setup
Configure your API key:
bashCopyexport GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Installation

Clone the repository
Install dependencies
Replace dummy model weights in weights/ with your trained models

Usage
Start the agent:
bashCopypython src/visual_ai_agent.py
The system will:

Initialize an OmniParser server (default: localhost:8000)
Start a Daydreams agent instance
Begin processing visual input
